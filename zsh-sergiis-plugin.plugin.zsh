# History size.
# The maximum number of events stored in the internal history list.
# If you use the HIST_EXPIRE_DUPS_FIRST option, setting this value larger than the SAVEHIST
# size will give you the difference as a cushion for saving duplicated history events.

export HISTSIZE=16777216  # 16,777,216 == 2^24
